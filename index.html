//	FILE:       index.php 
//	SYSTEM:     Natural - It's Picked 
//	AUTHOR:     Mark Addinall
//	DATE:       06/07/2013
//	SYNOPSIS:   VERY simple little web page for Natural - It's
//              Picked in South Africa.  They didn't wan't
//              much in the way of sophistication.  Only that
//              it should validate HTML5, CSS3 and look OK
//              on mobile devices.  So instead of dragging out
//              a behemoth CMS, I just did this one by hand
//              in KISS HTML5.  They seem to be happy enough
//              with it.  Been told to ignore IE 6,7,8.  It
//              will run.  It just will not display some of
//              the CSS3 transformations.
//
// TODO:        They haven't figure what they want down the
//              sidebar yet.  When that happens I'll stick
//              in the CSS to make it a responsive site.
//              ALSO, get a preferred contact number to stick
//              up onto the page.

          ceremonies.</p>

          <h2>Natural Health</h2>
          <h3>By Belinda Addinall</h3>

          <p>In today&#39;s busy world many of us suffer minor ailments, headache, 
          stress, sore feet and even sleep deprivation. 
          These are very easily fixed with a pill or two, but at what cost?</p>

          <p>There are alternatives to chemicals to remedy most common and non 
          life threatening ailments.  Medication prescribed by a doctor should 
          never be left for alternative remedies.  With any serious condition 
          always follow your physician’s advice and never use anything without 
          consulting him first.   The uses of essential oils  has been around for centuries.</p> 

          <p>History has suggested that the Egyptians were amongst the first people 
          to extensively make use of herbs and included their use in religion, beauty 
          as well as medicinal purposes. Essential oils and resins were also extensively 
          used in the embalming process. The Egyptians via the Mesopotamians had access 
          to distillation pots that have been found at Tepe Gawra dating back about 3,500 BC.</p>


          <p>The medicinal wisdom of the Egyptians were taken over and used by the ancient 
          Greeks - and the most well-known physician of that time - Hippocrates (c.460 - 377 BC) 
          was also a firm believer of treating the patient holistically and included essential 
          massage as a treatment.  The Persian physician Avicenna (980 - 1,037 AD) that has being 
          credited with perfecting the distillation process of essential oils. Since the late 
          1970 and early 80s the use of essential oils and aromatherapy has become a major part 
          of alternative and holistic health systems, and has a huge following across the world.  
          The term aromatherapy as we know it today was first used in 1937 by the French chemist 
          and perfumer R. M. Gattefosse. He was not a believer of the natural health movement but 
          was interested in the properties that essential oils exhibited. In 1910 he burnt his 
          hand badly in his laboratory and being the first available compound handy, treated his 
          badly burnt hand with pure undiluted lavender oil, which not only immediately eased the 
          pain, but helped heal the hand without any sign of infection or scar. He also found that 
          minute amounts of essential oils are absorbed by the body and interact with the body chemistry.</p> 

          <p>That being said never use oils you&#39;re not familiar with or that you have not 
          gotten from a professional therapist.  Please be aware that all oils except for 
          Lavender and Tea tree oils, should be used diluted.</p>  

          <p>Tea tree oil is <em>HIGHLY TOXIC</em> when ingested.  It is also a <em>POTENT IRRITANT</em> 
          of the conjunctiva of the eye.  Should be kept WELL out of the way of children.</p>

          <p>There are literally hundreds of oils are special and unique with wonderful uses.  
          I have chosen my favourites:</p> 

         <p><em>Jasmine</em> -  Antidepressant, aphrodisiac, antiseptic, sedative.  Dry, greasy, 
         irritated sensitive skin.  Muscular spasms &amp; sprains.  Catarrh, coughs, laryngitis.  
         Frigidity, labor pain, uterine disorders. Depression, nervous exhaustion and stress related 
         conditions.  &#34;Produces a feeling of optimism, confidence and euphoria - useful in cases where 
         apathy, indifference or listlessness occurs.&#34;</p>

         <p><em>Lavender</em> - One of the most versatile oils. Abscesses, acne, allergies, athlete’s 
         foot, boils, bruises, burns, dandruff, dermatitis, eczema, inflammations, insect bites &amp; stings, 
         insect repellent, psoriasis, ringworm, scabies, spots, sunburn.  Muscular aches &amp; pains, lumbago, 
         rheumatism, sprains.  Asthma, bronchitis, halitosis, laryngitis, throat infections, whooping cough.  
         Abdominal cramps, colic, flatulence, nausea.  Cystitis.  Depression, headaches, hypertension, 
         insomnia, migraine, nervous tensions &amp; stress. PMT, shock, vertigo.</p>

         <p><em>Tea Tree</em> - Anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antiviral, acne, athlete’s foot, blisters, 
         burns, cold sores, dandruff, herpes, insect bites, oily skin, rashes (nappy), spots, varicose, 
         warts, wounds (infected).  Asthma, bronchitis, coughs, sinusitis, tuberculosis, whooping cough.  
         Thrush cystitis.  Cold, fever, flu. Inhalation of treated steam,  <em>NOT INGESTION!</em></p>

         <p><em>Citronella</em> – Antiseptic, Eccessive, perpetration, oily skin, insect repellent, colds, 
         flu, fatigue.</p>

         <p>With these oils you can do a lot holistically for your family already, Jasmine in the proper 
         dose with cream makes a wonderful topical pain treatment. Lavender in a bath or a few drops on a 
         pillow helps with headaches and relaxes you for some good sleep. Tired feet can soak wonderfully 
         in some Tea Tree and if you mix it properly you can spray some in shoes that might not smell so nice.  
         Pure salt with dried tea’s and herbs infused with essential oils make using the oils very easy and relaxing.</p>  

         <p>Reducing the use of Chemicals should be motivated by one thing, your skin. Your biggest and only 
         exposed organ!  The barrier that protects our internal organs from our environment. If we can deduce 
         that small amounts of essential oils are absorbed and interacts with the body chemistry I think it’s 
         safe to say everything we put on our skin does the same.  When we are tested for allergens they use 
         our skin to perform the tests on.  Medicines like morphine is available in patch form, easier for 
         the body to absorb. Nicotine patches are available to help smokers quit.</p>   

         <p>We know our skin reacts to temperature, water and numerous other variables.  Most of which are 
         actually visible, we shiver in the cold and perspire in heat.   A rash can appear from a negative 
         reaction to something we ingest or put on our skin.  As far as Essential Oils go a Negative 
         reaction is a rarity.</p>

         <p>If you are allergic to Lemons its safe to assume you will be allergic to Lemon oil.  The most 
         common allergy that most people are not aware of is Nut.  I do not use any Nut oils as carrier 
         oils for that reason.</p>

         <p>This brings me to my ultimate favorite of any and all oils.  Olive Oil, the one oil every 
         house should have.  I know that the different kinds of Olive Oil are confusing. One rule, 
         it has to be cold pressed.  Mom it is amazing for your hair and skin just add and rub.  
         Dads have it over salad it&#39;s the only known oil to actively remove cholesterol build up. 
         You can not go wrong with having it in your house.  It’s in my opinion the safest carrier oil to use.</p>

         <p>It&#39;s very hard to decide which oils to share with others so I chose the ones most commonly 
         found and with every day uses. I am always available to help with advice and guidance. I learn 
         new things every day full stop we grow and discovery discover amazing natural ways of making our 
         life&#39;s journey a safe and happy one.</p>

         <h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>

         <ul>
             <li>
             Can I drink essential oils?
             </li>
             <li>
Considering that it takes 4000(1814.37kg) pounds of rose petals to make 1(453grams) pound of essential oil, the concentration should tell us that a safe dose is unlikely!  Some oils are toxic, so No!
             </li>

             <li>
Have your products been tested on animals?
             </li>

             <li>
Absolutely Not! In addition, all our skin and hair care products contain only Plant (herb, flower etc) derived ingredients
             </li>

             <li>
Why is quality important with essential oils?
             </li>

             <li>
To obtain acceptable results with aromatherapy it&#39;s vital to use only the very finest quality pure essential oils.   Inferior quality essential oils deliver unpredictable results meaning ultimately you would have wasted your money and risked your health.  Using poor quality oils ou may have an allergic reaction to the oil and experience a skin rash, or other side effects.
             </li>


             <li>
What is the difference between Aromatherapy oils and Essential oils?
             </li>

             <li>
Aromatherapy Oil is usually a 2% dilution of an essential oil and 98% almond or grape seed oil. Which is bad value for money, as it’s just a form of massage oil sold in 10ml bottles. Nut oils should be avoided as they are high risk as allergens.  Essential oils are undiluted products that have been extracted from flowers, herbs, leaves, grasses, roots, woods, barks, spices, fruits, or gum. Of which most should not be used without carrier oil.
             </li>


             <li>
How should my Essential Oils be stored?
             </li>

             <li>
Store oils always away from direct sunlight. Store them in dark bottles and if possible in a fridge that set between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius.
             </li>


             <li>
How long do essential oils last?
             </li>

             <li>
Except for a few exceptions, all steam distilled essential oils have a shelf life of at least 2 years, and even more when stored properly.  Tea Tree, Pine and Fir oils are the above mentioned exceptions. They have a shelf life of 12 to 18 months, due to certain components in their natural chemical composition. 
             </li>

             <li>
Can I use Essential Oils safely with other products?
             </li>

			 <li>
Yes Essential oils need to be diluted, to be used safely.  I always recommend a professional mixes your products or you do it under their advice and guidance.
             </li>

             <li>
Can I be allergic to an Essential Oil?
             </li>

             <li>
If you are allergic to Lemons its safe to assume you will be allergic to the Lemon Essential Oil.  We all have allergies and thus test on a small space first before using any oil.  Avoid carrier oils that are known allergens.
             </li>


             <li>
Can I use cooking Olive Oil?
             </li>

             <li>
High quality Olive Oil should be used and unfortunately most Cooking oils are not the highest quality.  The healthy olive oils have been made by the cold pressed method.  Olive Oil should be bought from an Essential Oil Company to be guaranteed of the quality.
             </li>


             <li>
Can I steam with Essential oils?
             </li>

             <li>
Yes you can, people with asthma should however not use this treatment.  This is very effective for upper respiratory infections.  Please always remember to not use any product without your doctor&#39;s consent if you’re under treatment.
             </li>
